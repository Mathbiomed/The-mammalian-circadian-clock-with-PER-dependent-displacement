# The-mammalian-circadian-clock-with-PER-dependent-displacement
Mathematica codes for simulating circadian rhtyhms of mammalian cells. See Otobe et al., Phosphorylation of DNA-binding domins of CLOCK-BMAL1 complex for PER-dependent inhibition in circadian clock of mammalian cells, PNAS (2024) for details.

## Code Description
1. Figure 2.nb
> This code simulates the KO of Clock and Bmal1, and the overexpression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in Figure 2.

2. Figure 4.nb
> This code simulates the Asp/Glu and Ala mutations of CLOCK and BMAL1 on phosphorylation sites in Figure 4.

3. Supplementary Figure 7.nb
> This code simulates the SA mutations of CLOCK and BMAL1 under DD/LD conditions in Supplementary figure 7.
